# Project: A 15-puzzle
This is a group assignment I did with my classmate in the course Object Oriented Programming.

## Task
A 15-puzzle is a game with 15 tiles arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns. One space is always empty. The game consists of shuffling the tiles and then sorting them into the correct numerical order by sliding them, one at a time, into the empty space 
(which will then move to a new position), thereby rearranging the tiles.
Your task is to build a digital 15-puzzle in Java.
